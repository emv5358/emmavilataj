### 🌐 Language Detection using RNNs on Tatoeba
Multi-lingual classifier detecting 10 languages from sentence-level inputs.  
🔹 Modeled as a sequence classification task using RNN  
🔹 Trained on 20K sentences (train/validation) for multilingual inference  

---

### ✨ Spell-Checker with Transformers (Noisy Text Correction)
Developed a Transformer-based translation model for bilingual spell-checking (FR → EN).  
🔹 Handled tokenized datasets with misspellings and grammatical errors  
🔹 Built on parallel noisy-clean corpora to enhance cross-lingual error correction  

---

### 📈 Predictive Modeling in Targeted Marketing
